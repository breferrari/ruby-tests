Time is the major challenge here. I study CS during the morning and work as a developer during the rest of the day.
I'll have to manage to do my homework as a CS grad, learn the things I need to use at work (and a good thing, Ruby is one of them) and also have some
time to rest, go to the gym, do other things to unwind.
